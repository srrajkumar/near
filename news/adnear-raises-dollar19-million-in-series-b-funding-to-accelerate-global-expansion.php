			    <p>Near, a leading location intelligence company, today announced  it has raised US$19 million from Telstra Ventures and Global Brain as part of  its strategic plan to expand into multiple new markets. Both its existing  investors, Sequoia Capital and Canaan Partners, also participated in the  capital raising round.</p>
                <p>Near has developed insights from anonymous device users  across Asia Pacific using their historical location footprint and real-world  offline data. Leveraging these unique insights, the company is able to  programmatically send relevant ads to mobile audiences on behalf of advertisers  using its proprietary real-time bidding platform. It has rapidly grown its  client base to include 100s of marquee brands such as P&amp;G, Woolworths,  Audi, Unilever, BMW, Ford, Samsung, IKEA, and Adidas .</p>
                <p>Mark Sherman, Managing Director at Telstra Ventures said,  &quot;Mobile advertising continues to grow rapidly across Asia Pacific. Telstra  Ventures recognizes the value that Near&rsquo;s probabilistic, data-driven approach  brings to advertisers and we&rsquo;re excited to be able to provide capital to  accelerate the expansion of Near&rsquo;s operations.&quot; Mark Sherman will now  join the Near Board of Directors.</p>
                <p>Anil Mathews, CEO of Near said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to be  joined by investors such as Telstra Ventures and Global Brain in this journey.  Our proprietary technology enables us to help major brands across Asia Pacific  fine-tune their consumer targeting by having access to real-time location  intelligence. Location data-driven insights are extremely powerful and  marketers can use these data points to understand consumer behaviour and also  build customized campaigns as per their target audience.&rdquo; Mathews also added:  &ldquo;We are constantly experimenting with location datasets for various use-cases  and will be productizing some of these in the coming months.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Yasuhiko Yurimoto, President and CEO, Global Brain Corp  said, &ldquo;We appreciated Near's superior technologies and highly experienced  team, and firmly believe that Near will become a leading player in the global  adtech market in the near future.&quot;</p>
                <p>Mohit Bhatnagar, Managing Director, Sequoia Capital said,  &ldquo;Near has been focused on analyzing location data at scale to understand user  behaviour, and the response from clients across markets has been phenomenal. We  believe that markets such as Japan present significant opportunities for  Near&rsquo;s technology and we look forward to leveraging our expertise and network  to help the company succeed in these markets.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Commenting on the investment, Rahul Khanna, Managing  Director of Canaan India, said, &ldquo;Over the last year, Near has seen a 12x  growth in its device user base and we are very excited about Near taking its  offerings to new markets. With data-driven marketing opportunities increasing  by the day, Near&rsquo;s data insights become very valuable&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In 2012 Near closed its Series A round of funding of  US$6.3 million from Sequoia Capital and Canaan Partners to support its  expansion in the Asia Pacific region and grow the team.
