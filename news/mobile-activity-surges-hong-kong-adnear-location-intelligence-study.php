											 <p>Evenings are seen to be the preferred engagement period across key shopping and business areas in Hong Kong. Additionally, shopping areas like Mongkok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Causeway Bay see 70% higher mobile usage as compared to business areas like Admirality and Central according to the recent study conducted by Near, a leading Location Intelligence Company. The study analyzed over 100,000 users across 6 locations from July to November 2014 through Nears proprietary technology to understand the mobile user behavior across Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The research stats indicate that most users are found on Gaming, Social Networking and Entertainment apps. Also, weekends see higher mobile engagement from males, while females are seen engaged more on weekdays. Business areas see high footfall on weekdays whereas shopping areas see higher mobile usage on weekends.</p>
<p>More mobile activity was seen in the 25-35 years age group. Male users were found to be mobile savvy in most age groups. However, in the 16 - 24 years age category, females topped the league at 36% while males were at 30%. Mongkok saw high percentage of users aged between 16-24 years as compared to other locations.

<p>Amrita De La Pena, Regional Director, South East Asia &amp; Hong Kong, Near commented, "The study clearly demonstrates the immense power of location data especially in deriving actionable consumer insights. Marketers can access our vast pool of mobile audiences in targeted locations to get superior returns on their marketing dollars. The study shows that mobile users present in multiple locations are 7x more engaged on an average as compared to the users seen only in one location. This could be a great opportunity to reach commuters via mobile." </p>
<p>  Samsung and Apple top the mobile devices category as 31% of the users are found to be browsing on their Samsung phones followed by 21% of the users on Apple. Central sees high iOS users compared to its counterparts. iOS users are 2 to 5 times more engaged on mobile as compared to Android users. <br><br>
