											<p>Aditi Kohli is now the General Manager for South East Asia and Hong Kong for Near, and will be responsible for scaling Near’s business in the region with key partnerships and strategic deals.

<p>“Aditi has been a great and valuable asset since her joining Near in early 2015. She has been instrumental in closing global deals across the spectrum - supply, demand, transaction and other partnerships for Near. She’s built relationships with the eco-system players across the world and has been a great ambassador for Near,” said Shobhit Shukla, our Co-Founder and Chief Revenue Officer. </p>

<p>“As she brings with her a deep understanding of the Near technology stack and the overall eco-system, we believe she would be a great asset for the team in driving adoption of Allspark in South East Asia and Hong Kong,” added Shobhit.</p>



<p> “I am looking forward to creating awareness and drive adoption of Near’s Ambient Intelligence Platform and SaaS products among partners and enterprises to help with their data-driven decisions. I strongly believe that Ambient Intelligence is the core to map the consumer journeys across channels and I couldn’t be more excited to lead Near’s South East Asia & Hong Kong business through its next phase of growth,” said Aditi Kohli, our General Manager for South East Asia & Hong Kong. </p>
