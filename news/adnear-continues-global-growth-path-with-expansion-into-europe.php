Global marquee brand clients include P&amp;G, Audi, Unilever, BMW, Adidas, Ford, Samsung, and IKEA.</p>

<p>Shobhit Shukla, Chief Revenue Office at Near commented: &ldquo;By combining mobile user data with our proprietary technology, Near provides marketers with the opportunity to connect the digital user to the real world.Having established our proposition in APAC, expansion into Europe is a logical next step in our strategy, which is being driven directly by advertiser demand in the region.&rdquo;</p>
