			     <p> We are the finalists in Mob-Ex Awards 2014, the dedicated  annual awards for mobile marketing industry, with 5 nominations across 4  categories- Best Integration of Mobile, Best Location based Marketing, Best  Mobile Advertising Solution &amp; Best use of Social Platform.</p>
                 
<p>We are super excited for the results which shall be declared  on January 16th in Singapore since we entered the Singapore market  only in June 2013, and are already being recognised for our work!</p>

<p>According to Mob-Ex, nineteen high profile judges were  selected across the digital marketing, media, and technology fields to judge  the 2014 Mob-Ex Awards.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Amongst the brands who gave us the opportunity to prove our  mobile audience targeting expertise, we got nominated for-</p>

<ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left;">Audi&rsquo;s Land of Quattro </h4>

                    <p>The objective of the campaign was to  reinforce the benefits of its Quattro technology, Audi&rsquo;s signature all-wheel  drive technology which has long been associated with making drivers feel safe  and confident when driving in adverse conditions and to establish Singapore as  the land of Quattro with its challenging road conditions. Adverse road  conditions were identified as &ldquo;quattro&rdquo; zones, and the in-app ad was shown to  Audi&rsquo;s target segment- the affluent &amp; the technologically savvy consumers  as soon as they entered the zone. The ad linked the consumer to Audi&rsquo;s Facebook  page and get more details. The 5 week campaign resulted in a good number of  facebook page visits.</p>
                <p style="color:#da041c">The Audi campaign  is nominated for &ldquo;Best Mobile Advertising Solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;Best Location based  Marketing&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Best use of social platform&rdquo;</p>
               <p class="img"> <img src="<?php IMAGE('news/audi.png'); ?>" style="width:80%;" alt=""/></p>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left;">P&amp;G&rsquo;s Premium Skin care brand SK-II </h4>
                  

                <p>The objective of the campaign was to target  females within Changi Airport on their mobile devices and drive awareness for  the new product exclusively available at the SK-II store within the airport.  This was in addition to the existent traditional media push, but was more  engaging as the in-app ad was shown to the right consumer at the right time.  The 3 month campaign had an extremely good CTR, helping SK-II achieve its  desired result</p>
                 <p  style="color:#da041c"> The SK-II campaign  is nominated for &ldquo;Best Integration of Mobile&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Best Location based  Marketing&rdquo;</p>
