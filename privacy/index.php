                         <h2>Near’s Technology Privacy Practices</h2>
                            <p>Near’s technology collects information about the location of mobile devices and associated app information. The information collected is provided to Near by mobile app partners who have obtained appropriate consumer consent to collect and share such information. Here are the important ground rules under which Near operates:</p>
                            <ul >
                                 <li>Near never actively requests from consumers or stores personally identifiable information.</li>
                                 <li>Near gives an option for all users to opt-out at any time from location usage for advertising.</li>
                                 <li>Near complies with local laws in countries that are covered by its service.</li>
                                 <li>Near does not share any data with third parties other than service providers acting on Near’s behalf and analytics info with the respective advertisers/publishers.</li>
                                </ul>
								
                               <h2 style=" font-size:18px;">Types of Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>Near obtains location data of devices from business partners, which are generally publishers (mobile app owners), mediation platforms and ad exchanges. Many of these partners also help deliver advertising onto your mobile device. We require that these partners have your permission prior to sending us location information obtained at the time of installing the app itself, which enables the developer to share select user information with third party platforms. We also collect other Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our technology, including but not limited to device type, IDFA or Android ID (anonymous advertising identifier associated with your mobile device), mobile browser type, operating system, log information, and IP address etc. However, the information we are able to collect may differ among the various app developers/publishers that we work with as we closely integrate and comply with their privacy policies. We don’t collect any personally identifiable information (“PII”) such as name, email or telephone number via our technology. In other words, we are unable to identify who you are via our technology.</p>
<p>In some instances Near collects information such as points of interest (“POI”) data, restaurant location/pricing data, real estate pricing data, etc. from other publically available third party data sources and combines this data with information we already have about you. Near also supplements, appends and annotates its data with licensed data from third party sources and partners such as data providers and geo-demography vendors for the purposes of verifying and improving the quality of data models. However, none of this information collected contains any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>Near uses the information thus collected from its mobile partners and other secondary and tertiary sources to power its analytics technology to derive actionable consumer insights for marketers and publishers. Information collected is used to build user behavior/interest inference data models and audience/interest profiles that could be used for delivering relevant ads or other content to the user.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Tracking Technologies</h2>

<p>Near’s technology uses pseudonymous identifiers associated with your mobile device in order to help make the digital advertisements you see more relevant to you. We employ hashing, encryption and de-identification techniques to help ensure your privacy is safeguarded.</p>
<p>Near employs session cookies in some of its products mainly for tracking ad conversions on 3rd party pages. These cookies are valid only one particular session (an ad impression) and are expired immediately afterwards. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. </p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Opt-out Provisions</h2>

<p>Mobile advertising networks/exchanges, who supply some of the data used by Near, support users to opt-out of interest-based ads. Users can opt-out of interest-based ads by enabling “Limit Ad Tracking” setting on iOS mobile devices and “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” setting on Android devices. Near honors these opt-out settings for that user in that it will not use information collected from that device to serve ads targeted based on a user’s inferred interests or share that data with any external systems or partners for targeting. In addition, Near provides free “Allspark Opt Out Manager” iOS and Android mobile apps that users can download and use to opt-out of data collection or profiling done by Near.</p>

<p>While users may decide to opt-out of interest-based ads, they should remember that doing so will prevent Near from providing them with a personalized experience and this may impair the quality of their overall user experience. Also, though Near always honor users’ opt-out settings, some app developers/publishers may not allow users to opt-out of all the information collected, as it would hinder effective ad delivery. In such cases, users might be required to purchase a paid version of those apps to disable ads.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;" >Website Privacy Practices</h2>
<h2 >Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
<p>Our website is primarily designed to provide information to our clients, which are typically businesses. Near collects Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from its website, www.near.co, when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on this website. Near uses this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, Near will store your PII for no longer than 12 months for record keeping purposes.</p>

<h2 >Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>As is true of most websites, Near also automatically collects certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) from visitors to this website. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system.  We use this information to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Controlling the use of your information</h2>
<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>The security of the consumer’s information is important to us. Near has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once it is received. This includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; therefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p>We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.  </p>


<h2>Accessing Your Information</h2>
<p>If you wish to opt-out from having your location information collected or used you may do so by turning it off at the device level or emailing us at privacy@near.co. If we have collected personal or non -personal information about you and you wish to update, correct, or delete inaccuracies within that information, you may contact us as described in this policy.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.  </p>

<h2>Information Relating to Children</h2>
<p>Near’s products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older and we don’t collect PII via our technology. Near does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13 via our website. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 13 (e.g., a child sends us an email with her postal address and date of birth), we will use reasonable efforts to immediately remove that information from our records.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:18px;">Choice</h2>
<p>Near partners with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities or interests.  If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#dd1f26; text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #dd1f26; text-decoration:none;">here</a>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<p>You may sign-up to receive communications from us.  If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may update your email preferences by using the “unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you or by contacting us at privacy@near.co. </p>



<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
<p>Near does not rent, sell or share PII with non-affiliated third parties without user consent. The company may, however, share PII with trusted third-party partners who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities, such as providing cloud computing infrastructure or payment processing. These third party service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for Near.</p>
<p>As required by its business, Near may also share non-PII information with third parties such as DSPs, DMPs and other platforms to facilitate the usage of the data by Near’s partners and clients. In these cases, the third party does not own the data and the ownership of that data stays with Near or with Near’s partners and clients.</p>
<p>Near may disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by public authorities or by law pursuant to judicial or other government requests, subpoenas, warrants, orders, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
<p>Finally, Near may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Near is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your PII.  We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.  </p>


<h2 style="font-size:18px;" >Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This privacy policy is subject to change. If the company plans to make any material or substantive changes in our privacy practices, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice on the website prior to the changes being made.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  </p>
